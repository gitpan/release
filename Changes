0.16 - Wed Mar 19 15:38:00 2003 (Andy Lester)
	* No new features
	* Removed the dependency on Test::Pod

0.15 - Fri Mar 14 17:23:30 2003 (Andy Lester)
	* Support for the PERL environment variable.
	* Cleaned up tabs 'n' spaces in the source.  Shouldn't
	  affect anything in how you use the program.

0.14 - Wed Mar 12 10:09:00 2003 (Andy Lester)
	* 0.13 is an incorrect distro.  This is what you want.

0.13 - Wed Mar 12 09:58:00 2003 (Andy Lester)
	Most of these changes are from Max Maischein.  Cross-platform
	compatibility should be a lot better.  Thanks, Max!

	* Prompts for passwords that are not set in the environment.

	* Fixed a bug in checking for required fields

	* Uses "$Config{make}" instead of "make".

	* Moved all backticks into a subroutine "run", that also echoes
	  the command if "-d" is set.

	* Added a check whether the file-to-distribute actually exists,
	  before making the ftp connection.

	* The regex to guess the distname from the tardist output
	  needed some whitespace added to work with Win32.

	* Added support for passive FTP.

0.12 - Thu Mar  6 13:55:47 2003 (Andy Lester)
	Most of the changes in this revision are from Chris Nandor:

	* Add basic help page
	
	* Add more debugging information (dump `` output)

	* Add command-line switches for help, debug, and test (exits after
	  testing phase)

	* Allow not using either the CPAN or SourceForge.net (but not both)

	* Check cvs exit status

	* Do not update CVS automatically; release will exit if it sees a U
	  anyway, so might as well just let the developer handle it

	* Allow modification of "release name" via regex in .releaserc

	* Update docs

	* General cleanup

0.11 - Mon Mar  3 11:58:42 2003 (Andy Lester)
	* Patches to make this less brian-specific.  Thanks to Chris
	  Nandor for taking it upon himself to do so.

	* Removed a lot of dependencies on external modules. 

0.10 - Wed Dec 11 16:40:53 2002 (brian d foy)
	* prompt for comments to put in Changes, commit Changes, and
	use comments in SourceForge change log notes

	* guess the release file name from 'make dist' so the first
	argument is now optional

	* put the right date in the SourceForge release date
