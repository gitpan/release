	* Patches to make this less brian-specific.  Thanks to Chris
	  Nandor for taking it upon himself to do so.

	* Removed a lot of dependencies on external modules. 

0.10 - Wed Dec 11 16:40:53 2002
	* prompt for comments to put in Changes, commit Changes, and
	use comments in SourceForge change log notes

	* guess the release file name from 'make dist' so the first
	argument is now optional

	* put the right date in the SourceForge release date
